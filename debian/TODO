* switch fonts-font-awesome to fonts-fork-awesome (or even using alternative
  depends?)

* next upstream version: don't exclude html files, just don't install them into
  the package to avoid need for rebuilding upstream tarballs.

* rethink package splitting, i.e. something like...
  - netdata:               meta package, depending on netdata-daemon, netdata-web
  - netdata-daemon:        just the daemon and systemd/init integration, -O3 and sse2
  - netdata-daemon-legacy: daemon compiled with -O2 and without sse2 etc.
  - netdata-web:           webfrontend, not needed on small devices
  - netdata-common:        plugins, checks, etc (everything arch all).

  - netdata-doc:           htmldoc that can be used via apache2
  - netdata-apache2:       apache2 conf snipped to enable netdata via reverse proxy

* keep depends minimal and put everything to recommends/suggests

* check netdata.conf, netdata.init, netdata.service etc. with upstream

* check if freeipmi plugin can be run with caps instead setuid
