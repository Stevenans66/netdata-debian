* switch fonts-font-awesome to fonts-fork-awesome (or even using alternative
  depends?)

* next upstream version: don't exclude html files, just don't install them into
  the package to avoid need for rebuilding upstream tarballs.

* rethink package splitting, i.e. something like...
  - netdata:        meta package, depending on netdata-daemon, netdata-web
  - netdata-daemon: just the daemon and systemd/init integration
  - netdata-web:    webfrontend, not needed on small devices
  - netdata-common: plugins, checks, etc.

* keep depends minimal and put everything to recommends/suggests
